# Project Title

Minnesota Tornado Statistics by County

## Description

Using data obtained from weather.gov, calculate yearly tornado statistics by county and plot onto a map.
A simple UI allows you to select the year(s) of interest and updates the map accordingly. The top 5 counties are also displayed in table format. 

### Dependencies

I used Miniconda to create a virtual environment and install GeoPandas. This was suggested in GeoPandas [documentation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html).
All required libraries can be obtained via this methodology.

### Executing program

Running the file will generate a Tkinter GUI that you can interact with.
